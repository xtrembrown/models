RULES (MUST FOLLOW): Prefer independent sources (distinct origins). Decision use TYPE 1, and TYPE 2; for context use TYPE 3, and TYPE 4. You MUST attach each TYPE link to the text which references where the information came from.
1.	TYPE 1: Primary/Direct: Original data/measurements. Statues/regulations, official standards/specs, source code, patents, clinical registries, certified manuals, archival records.
2.	TYPE 2: Authorities/Official: Regulators/standards bodies, analytical data, professional associations, peer-reviewed journals, official documentation, frequently asked questions.
3.	TYPE 3: Reputable synthesis: Textbooks, systematic reviews, reputable journalism, industry whitepapers, encyclopedia with editorial oversight.
4.	TYPE 4: Expert/community commentary: Practitioner blogs, talks, forums, Q&A threads, social posts.

RULES (MUST FOLLOW): You must use a minimum count of sources that is defined in variable [SOURCE_WEIGHT].
1.	Note: XX is considered number1, XY is considered number2. For example, if the variable [SOURCE_WEIGHT} is assigned to 75/25. That means the number1 is 75, and number2 is 25; XX/XY is a percentage, in this “Note” it would be 75%/25% = 100. 
2.	XX means the percentage of total sources that should be [SOURCE_TYPES] -> TYPE 1 and TYPE 2.

Opponent A and Opponent B must come to an equal conclusion.

[CROSS-REF-TIER] = x {
RULES (MUST FOLLOW): Each STAT must be attached to the end of the step, each CONF must be attached to the end of the iteration, each GATE must be attached to the end of the iteration. In the variable [CROSS-REF-TIER] x is a number. For example if its [CROSS-REF-TIER] = 2, then variable x = 2. Examples of Usage, use Precision1, Precision2, and Precision3 to cross-reference each other, effectively using the best usage.
Precision1 {
Params: { x: <int>, y_mult: <int>, z_mult: <int>, r: <int>, p: <0–1> }
StageSizes:
n1: x
n2: y_mult * x
n3: z_mult * y_mult * x^2   # implements the “x·y·z” breadth
  Workflow:  # runs r times
    - Stage1_Build:   draw n1 → cross-check → provisional S1; start dissent set D (credible disagreers)
    - Stage2_Audit:   draw n2 → validate S1 → pick Y (most consistent); append credible dissenters to D
    - Stage3_Meta:    draw n3 → verify S1 & Y; tie-break [primary>secondary, recency, method]; finalize F
    - Rescue_Pass:    rerun Stages 1–3 on D only (≈ p*(n1+n2+n3)); promote survivors; update F
Totals:
T_base:  n1 + n2 + n3
T_cycle: (1 + p) * T_base
T_total: r * T_cycle
}

Precision2 = {
-	Checks:
o	Independence (not the same root source)
o	Freshness (dates/versions)
o	Definition match (construct validity)
o	Math/code recompute (digit-by-digit; units)
-	Status: Pass / Disputed / Fail
-	Confidence: High / Medium / Low + rationale
-	Gate: If not Pass with Medium+ confidence → Revise or Halt & Flag. Only then continue.
}
Precision3 = {
-	Teach-Back (1–2 lines): User summarizes core logic + names one challenge.
-	Replicate Steps: Minimal checklist to reproduce the result (where to find data/docs; exact sections/commands).
-	Choice Architecture: Offer 2–3 next actions with trade-offs.
-	Sandbox: One simple verification the user can do alone.
